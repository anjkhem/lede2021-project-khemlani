#This is my first ever data project, courtesy of the Lede Program at Columbia University.

#FOCUS: Changed sentiment for defendents in opioid lawsuits after their significant efforts 
#in COVID-19 response efforts through contracts with the Trump administration.
#I hope to find a trend that either tells us how investors adjusted their interest, if at all, 
#in the companies who were sued as a result of their very prominent responses to the pandemic.
#Specifically looking at largest among: Johnson & Johnson, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, CVS, Giant Eagle, RiteAid, 
#Walgreens/Duane Reade, Pfizer, Abbott, Albertsons, Costco, Eckerd, Express Scripts (Cigna), Fresenius, 
#Giant Food, Kmart, Kroger, McKinsey, Novartis, OptumRx(UHG), Safeway, Sandoz (XXX), ShopRite, 
#Sun Pharmaceuticals, Target, Wakefern, Walmart, Winn-Dixie. 
#So probably only: J&J, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, Cvs, Walgreens, Pfizer, Abbott, Cigna, UHG.
